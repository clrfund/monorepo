			"li2": "Coercion — when a person or entity threatens to punish others in some way if they don't vote for a particular outcome, e.g. blackmail",
			"p2": "These kinds of manipulation break voting systems by diverting them from their intended goal. Voting systems are generally designed to discover a group's preference between a number of specified outcomes. Each voter is expected to choose how to vote based on which outcomes they prefer and how their vote can effect the result.",
			"p3": "In an election where the outcomes are 1) Alice wins and 2) Bob wins, if I prefer Alice winning and believe my vote has a high enough chance of influencing the result to be worth the effort, I'll vote for Alice. Now, let's say Charlie offers me $1,000,000 to vote for Bob instead. For me, the possible outcomes of the election now shift to 1) Alice wins and 2) Bob wins and I get $1,000,000. In that scenario, I might vote for Bob even though I prefer Alice, and the election result will no longer reflect my preference between Bob and Alice, as was intended. If enough people are successfully bribed this way, the election will be a sham."
		},
		"vulnerability": {
			"h3": "Vulnerability of Public Voting Systems",

Otherwise, I can vote for Alice, tell Charlie I voted for Bob to get the $1,000,000, and the bribe has failed.",
			"p2": "In traditional elections, votes are secret, making it difficult to manipulate voters. But there aren't any secrets on public blockchains like Ethereum! In most existing voting systems on Ethereum, votes are public, which means manipulation is a serious threat."
		},

				"p3_t1": "From",

				"p4": "Whitelisted voters named Alice, Bob, and Charlie register to vote by sending their public key to a smart contract. Additionally, there is a central coordinator Dave, whose public key is known to all.",
				"p5": "When Alice casts her vote, she signs her vote with her private key, encrypts her signature with Dave's public key, and submits the result to the smart contract.",
				"p6": "Each voter may change her keypair at any time. To do this, she creates and signs a key-change command, encrypts it, and sends it to the smart contract. This makes it impossible for a briber to ever be sure that their bribe has any effect on the bribee's vote.",
				"p7": "If Bob, for instance, bribes Alice to vote a certain way, she can simply use the first public key she had registered ⁠— which is now void ⁠— to cast a vote. Since said vote is encrypted, as was the key-changing message which Alice had previously sent to Dave, Bob has no way to tell if Alice had indeed voted the way he wanted her to.",
				"p8": "Even if Alice reveals the cleartext of her vote to Bob, she just needs to not show him the updated key command that she previously used to invalidate that key.

			"p2": "Markets can be thought of as fund-distributors: sellers are the fund recipients, and buyers are the voters deciding what will be funded. In this case, the \"voting system\" is 1-dollar-1-vote: each buyer has exactly as much potential influence over where funds go as they have money to spend. This is also the case for traditional crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter.",
			"p3": "An advantage of this system is that each voter's influence is directly proportional to their need (at least, if we ignore wealth inequality). The more Alice needs pizza, the more pizza she'll buy, and the more funding will go to pizzerias.",
			"p4": "The disadvantage is that rich voters have an outsize influence on what gets funded. Alice may need pizza exactly as much as Bob needs movie tickets, but if Bob is twice as wealthy as Alice, he has twice as many \"votes\" to spend on going to the movies."

			"h3": "Private Grant-Givers",

			"p2": "An advantage of non-profits is that their non-profit status binds them to **act in the interest of some public mission**, rather than seeking profit above all.",

		"democratic": {

			"p2": "On the good side, these systems are much less oligarchical than markets—if we ignore the ability to convert money into influence via the media, among other complications.",
			"p3": "In exchange for less oligarchy, though, influence also poorly reflects need in 1-person-1-vote systems. A half-time Florida resident has the same voting power in Florida elections as a full-time resident, as long as both qualify to vote, even though the full-time resident may have twice as much riding on the result."

			"p1": "Quadratic funding is a compromise between 1-dollar-1-vote and 1-person-1-vote. Participants vote on how to distribute pooled funds by making individual donations, but each person's influence, rather than being the amount of money they spend, is the square root of that amount.",
			"p2": "Compared to 1-dollar-1-vote in the market, quadratic funding makes it exponentially easier for the influence of many poorer people to outweigh that of a single rich person:",
			"li1": "1-dollar-1-vote: 1 person paying $10,000 has the same influence as 100 people paying $100",
			"li2": "Quadratic funding: 1 person paying $10,000 has the same influence as 100 people paying $1 or 10 people paying $100",
