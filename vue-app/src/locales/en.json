      "p2": "These kinds of manipulation break voting systems by diverting them from their intended goal. Voting systems are generally designed to discover a group's preference between a number of specified outcomes. Each voter is expected to choose how to vote based on which outcomes they prefer and how their vote can effect the result.",
      "p3": "In an election where the outcomes are 1) Alice wins and 2) Bob wins, if I prefer Alice winning and believe my vote has a high enough chance of influencing the result to be worth the effort, I'll vote for Alice. Now, let's say Charlie offers me $1,000,000 to vote for Bob instead. For me, the possible outcomes of the election now shift to 1) Alice wins and 2) Bob wins and I get $1,000,000. In that scenario, I might vote for Bob even though I prefer Alice, and the election result will no longer reflect my preference between Bob and Alice, as was intended. If enough people are successfully bribed this way, the election will be a sham."

Otherwise, I can vote for Alice, tell Charlie I voted for Bob to get the $1,000,000, and the bribe has failed.",
      "p2": "In traditional elections, votes are secret, making it difficult to manipulate voters. But there aren't any secrets on public blockchains like Ethereum! In most existing voting systems on Ethereum, votes are public, which means manipulation is a serious threat."
