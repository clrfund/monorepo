    <h2>Register your project</h2>
    <p>
      In order to participate in a funding round as a project,
      <span v-if="$store.getters.isSelfRegistration"
        >you'll need to submit an application to join the recipient registry
        (via an on-chain transaction)</span
      ><span v-else
        >you'll need to contact the round coordinator to submit an
        application</span
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      MACI, our anti-bribery tech, currently limits the amount of projects
      allowed per round.
      <links to="/about/maci">More on MACI</links>. The round only accepts a
      total of {{ maxRecipients }} projects, so we encourage you to apply early.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: all application data (except contact email address) will be publicly
      stored on-chain.
    </p>
    <h3>Submit your application</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Head over to the <links to="/join">Join page</links>.</li>
      <li>
        Click "See round criteria" and familiarize yourself with the criteria
        for projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you're familiar with the criteria and you're sure your project
        meets them,
        <span v-if="$store.getters.selfRegistration"
          >click "Add project." You'll see a series of forms to fill out asking
          for more information about your project</span
        >
        <span v-else
          >contact the round coordinator to add your project to the recipient
          registry.</span
        >
      </li>
      <template v-if="$store.getters.requireRegistrationDeposit">
        <li>
          With the forms finished, you can finish your submission:
          <ol>
            <li>Connect to the right network via your wallet of choice.</li>
            <li>
              Send a transaction (with a deposit of {{ depositAmount }}
              {{ depositToken }}) to the registry contract.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </template>
    </ol>

    <template v-if="$store.getters.requireRegistrationDeposit">
      <p>
        Projects are accepted by default, but the registry admin may remove
        projects that don't meet the criteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, your
        {{ depositToken }} will be returned once your application has been
        either accepted or denied. Note that metadata pointing to all your
        project information (but not contact information) will be stored
        publicly on-chain.

    <h2>Claim your funds</h2>
    <p>
      After a clr.fund round is finished, it's simple to claim your project's
      share of the funding. Return to your project's page: you will see a "claim
      funds" button if your project received contributions during the round.
      Submit the claim transaction to receive your funds.
    </p>
