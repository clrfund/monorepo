    <h2>Register your project</h2>
    <p class="text-body">
      In order to participate in a funding round as a project, you'll need to
      submit an application to join the recipient registry (via an on-chain
      transaction).
    </p>
    <p class="text-body">
      MACI, our anti-bribery tech, currently limits the amount of projects
      allowed per round.
      <links to="/about/maci">More on MACI</links>. The round only accepts a
      total of {{ maxRecipients }} projects, so we encourage you to apply early.
    </p>
    <p class="text-body">
      Note: all application data (except contact email address) will be publicly
      stored on-chain.
    </p>
    <h3>Submit your application</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Head over to the <links to="/join">Join page</links>.</li>
      <li>
        Click "See round criteria" and familiarize yourself with the criteria
        for projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once you're familiar with the criteria and you're sure your project
        meets them, click "Add project." You'll see a series of forms to fill
        out asking for more information about your project.
      </li>
      <li>
        With the forms finished, you can finish your submission:
        <ol>
          <li>Connect to the right network via your wallet of choice.</li>
          <li>
            Send a transaction (with a deposit of {{ depositAmount }}
            {{ depositToken }}) to the registry contract.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="text-body">
      Projects are accepted by default, but the registry admin may remove
      projects that don't meet the criteria.
    </p>
    <p class="text-body">
      In any case, your
      {{ depositToken }} will be returned once your application has been either
      accepted or denied. Note that metadata pointing to all your project
      information (but not contact information) will be stored publicly
      on-chain.
    </p>
    <h2>Claim your funds</h2>
    <p class="text-body">
      After a clr.fund round is finished, it's simple to claim your project's
      share of the funding. Return to your project's page: you will see a "claim
      funds" button if your project received contributions during the round.
      Submit the claim transaction to receive your funds.
