The value created by TREE will is allocated to several pools, one being a Charity Pool. TREE also serves as the Governance Token of the TREE Charity Pool, meaning TREE holders receive a vote in how the Charity Fund is allocated to each Charity.\n\n**Resource on TREE:**\n* Intro Blog Post\n* Smart Contracts\n \n## Goals of our Grant\nSo far we are completely self funding. We have launched a DAO on IDChain and have built the Smart Contracts for TREE. WhalerDAO plans for utilizing funding: Our plan is to use the donations to help pay for a security audit of the smart contracts used in our first project TREE, an elastic supply token that generates funding for charities. The donations we receive in excess will directly fund the charity treasury used by TREE, and will eventually be paid out to charities as decided by TREE holders using Conviction Voting. If you also believe that we should be working towards how to use DeFi for good, help the ecosystem and fund our grant. This is a community driven project, so we're reaching out to you the community for help.",

        "description": "With the adoption of more ETH developers, the rollup is becoming the mainstream solution. However, **in the rollup solution of Layer 2, there is no direct transfer between Rollups**. \n\nTransfer from Rollup A to Rollup B needs to be transferred to the mainnet first and then to the target rollup, **which not only costs $4–10 in gas fee, but also takes 10 minutes or even a week to withdraw.** So far, the cross-rollup transfer solution and account are centralized.\n\n**Orbiter Finance** **solves this problem in a decentralized manner and aims to have smart contracts only on the destination side. Users can transfer tokens in a single contract within 1 block time.**\n\nKey features :\n\n**1.** **Support fully decentralized transfers between rollups**\n\nThere are some bridges now. We all know ZKSync, Optimistic and Arbitrum have communication bridges between Layer2 and Layer1 ( but there is no bridge between Rollups ). The most different point between Orbiter Finance and the existing bridges is that Orbiter Finance is a fully decentralized bridging protocol between Rollups, In other words，Orbiter Finance connects separated Rollups.\n\n**2. No withdraw time. Only need one block time.**\n\nSince Rollups requires proof of fraud or proof of validity to secure the block, these “proof” processes give us the withdraw time. The withdraw time of ZKSync is 10 minutes, Optimistic and Arbitrum take 7 days at least. As a result, there may be a large price differentials for the same assets on different rollups. Transfers between Rollups can be done in one block time.\n\n**3. Smart contract on destination side to ensure safety**\n\nAs we all know, Rollups cannot read each other’s data. They have to wait for the end of withdraw time, and then read the data on other Rollups via mainnet. Therefore, there is no real-time interoperability between the contracts on the different Rollups. And if you need to secure the real-time transaction, you can only validate the contracts on one of the Rollups to prevent data read errors. For each transaction transferred across Rollups in Orbiter Finance, the user will only interact with the contract on the destination side.\n\n**4. Extended to the POA sidechain and freely access by developers**\n\nSidechains such as BSC and xDAI also have lots of assets and users, and the need to transfer assets between Sidechains and Layer2 will also increase. Just implementing the light client of the POA chain on the ETH mainnet, Orbiter Finance can get block status on the target network to verify transfers occurring on these POA chains.\n\n**5. To be a DEX of cross-rollup and connect the separated liquidity**\n\nOrbiter Finance will serve as the infrastructure for real-time interoperability between rollups of Layer 2 in future development, that is, cross-rollup DEX. In addition, Orbiter Finance will try more extended use cases, such as liquidity pool reuse, mixed-currency protocol on Layer2…\n\n**6. Tokens will incentivize market makers, transaction users, and developers to accelerate the development of Orbiter Finance**\n\nIn Orbiter Finance’s decentralized settlement agreement, market makers and traders are required to work together to complete transactions. There are two roles running in the system:\n\n1. User: Replace your USDT in the RollupsA account with the USDT in the RollupsB account at a ratio of 1:1.\n2. Market maker: Own the USDT on RollupsB and also had a RollupsA account to receive the USDT on RollupsA, you opened a RollupsA block browser and could see who had transferred to you on rollups. Registers a market maker on the Orbiter Finance platform (which can only control the USDT on the RollupsB，but cannot control and check the RollupsA account in real time) and transfers the USDT on the RollupsB to the platform.\n\nTo meet the needs of these two roles and to protect their assets, Orbiter Finance, which only handles assets on RollupsA but not on RollupsB, has the following features:\n\n+ Market Makers’ order: Deposit the USDT on the RollupsB to Orbiter Finance platform. When the Market Maker is operating, there is no withdrawal permission.\n+ Users’ order: Users place orders on Orbiter Finance platform and register their purchase intention with a market maker. Then freezes the market maker’s operating funds, and the amount of orders available to the market maker is reduced.\n+ Token release: The market maker confirms that the user has transferred the same amount to the bank account and allow the user to withdraw the frozen funds.\n+ Dispute resolution: Market maker has not received the user’s transfer message in the bank account, or the transfer amount is wrong, or user has completed USDT transfer in RollupsA but does not receive payment from market maker in RollupsB. In any of the above cases, the participants can submit the evidence of transfer to the platform, and the platform will decide the direction of the frozen funds after verification (unfreezing and returning to the market maker’s account, or transferring money to the user’s account). The decision process is handled by the smart contract by verifying the Merkel tree transfer proof.\n\nVisit us at [Orbiter.finance](https://www.orbiter.finance/), follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Orbiter_Finance), join us on [Telegram](http://t.me/orbiterfi).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Orbiter_Finance/status/1406147597505495042?s=20 ",
