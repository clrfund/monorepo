If you want to support the health of the network by staking from home, but also want the benefits of reward smoothing (historically only been offered by staking service providers), you can now have the best of both worlds. By pooling together execution layer rewards, validators have access to the mean reward and enjoy distributions at fixed intervals. To join, validators change the fee recipient address in their validator client to our pool contract, connect their wallet, and claim their share of the rewards every two weeks.  \n\nNote that this project is designed as an open source (Apache License 2.0) pubic good, and the only fees that are being charged are split between trusted operators of the oracle network. This amount (1.5% on Goerli) is only meant to cover hard costs and is not meant to enrich the operators. The Smoothly team takes no fee and our oracle is treated the same as all other operators. \n",

We’ve received multiple bids and have decided to move forward with Sigma Prime.\n\n| Scale Goerli Implementation |\n\nRunning in parallel with the audit and continuing for 10 weeks, we will scale the Goerli implementation to a main net replica. These iterative changes are as follows: \n\nToday we’re reaching consensus with 3 node operators. Every 2 weeks we will be adding an additional Smoothly node operator until 6 operators are running together and reaching consensus on the state. During this time we will be experimenting with peer to peer connectivity which will allow an operator to query the root hash and the state of other node operators. Four additional weeks are allocated to troubleshoot and implement fixes during operator scaling. \nCurrently, node operators are voting and updating the state of the contract daily. This is great for testing features and logic but does not reflect the design of our mainnet implementation, which is 2 weeks between state updates. Each week for 6 weeks, we will increase the duration between state updates by two days until the 2 week duration is reached. Four additional weeks are allocated to troubleshoot and implement fixes during the duration increase. \nWe’re currently monitoring 3 out of 7 public relays on Goerli. Each week for 4 weeks we’ll add an additional relay until all 7 Goerli relays are being monitored for fee recipient changes. An option for mainnet may be to forego the relay enforcement and instead monitor it on the backend until sufficient time has passed to feel confident in all data from relays. ",

        "teamDescription": "Kody Sale (Founder) \n\nMy background is in Mechanical Engineering and am a technologist at heart. I rabbit holed my way into crypto in 2014 when I volunteered my GPU to the distributed computing project Folding@Home.  Folding@Home is a project that aims to develop therapeutics for Alzheimer’s through protein folding simulations. The distributed nature of the project led me to the Bitcoin whitepaper, which hit home as I graduated college in 2009 in the midst of the bank bailouts.  \n\n   My journey into Ethereum began in 2017 when I discovered a network that allowed for more than just sending and receiving BTC. After exploring various parts of the ecosystem, I found my home in staking. Staking resonated with me due to the high priority of inclusion; anyone with an internet connection and consumer hardware could participate in the consensus of a global settlement layer. The welcoming and supportive community at ETH staker played a significant role in my decision to become a home staker.  \n\n The project started as a simple idea, and the codebase has grown beyond my initial expectations.  I feel a strong sense of purpose in building something that aligns with the core ethos of the staking community. My goal is for Smoothly to be sustainable and to provide tangible value to the community at near zero cost. I have self-funded the project and have no plans to raise money publicly or through tokenization. I see Smoothly as a tool to give home validators access to a pooling mechanism currently reserved for centralized entities. I’m also aware of the plans to include PBS and MEV Smoothing (or burn) in a future Ethereum hard fork and would love to contribute to that research by collaborating with existing infrastructure providers in the MEV-Boost ecosystem.",

The choice of protocol is characterized by a number of factors that apply to the protocol: degree of decentralization, permissionlessness, tokenomics of any liquid staked token, commitment to self-limit, etc. Project alignment can also be gauged by softer measures: communication from the team, willingness to engage with the community, funding of public goods, good faith participation in protocol-level discussions, etc. These are things that we aim to educate the wider Ethereum community about when they go to make a decision on where to stake.\n\nThe EthStaker community is a community of people who are passionately interested in this technology developing with as much success as possible. There are currently two main groups that we target:\n\n- **Stakers**: We provide a space for stakers to ask questions, search through old questions, ask for help from seasoned stakers, get guidance on what protocols to use or what hardware to buy, and facilitate discussions among the community. We also create and support open source software that makes the process easier and makes solo staking a competitive option.\n- **Projects**: We give new protocols a platform to communicate with the staking community, get to know them, help battle-test them on testnets, give feedback on user experience, make noise when they have calls to action, host community calls that provide a forum for Q&A, discussion, and plain-language explanation of their use case.",

        "description": "**Empowering Underprivileged Communities in Latin America Through Financial Literacy and Blockchain Education**\n\nIn Latin America, underprivileged communities face significant barriers to financial stability and independence. Limited access to financial education, coupled with a lack of understanding of emerging technologies like blockchain, leaves these communities at a disadvantage in today's rapidly evolving digital economy.\n\nAt Proof of Integrity, we are committed to breaking down these barriers through our **#aPRENDOcripto** program, which promotes **financial literacy and blockchain education** among **underprivileged communities in Latin America**. Our four-part workshop series provides hands-on experience with decentralized technologies, practical and theoretical content, and close mentorship to facilitate the learning process.\n\n# Our Impact\nThrough our #aPRENDOcripto program, we have achieved:\n\n- Over 160 graduates equipped with the skills and knowledge to better manage their personal finances and understand the fundamentals of blockchain technology.\n- 14 successful editions of #aPRENDOcripto across in underprivileged communities in Buenos Aires city (Argentina), Buenos Aires Province, Chubut Province (Argentina) and Maldonado (Uruguay)\n- A growing network of program participants who are inspired to continue learning and exploring the world of blockchain and decentralized technologies.\n\nWe believe that with continued guidance and opportunities for professional development, our graduates will soon be able to participate actively in the decentralized ecosystem and contribute to the growth of the crypto community.\n\n# #aPRENDOcripto Goals\n\nOur program aims to achieve the following goals:\n\n- **Equip Participants with Personal Finance Tools:** We provide attendees with the necessary tools to manage their income effectively, such as budgeting, saving, and debt management. We also emphasize the importance of financial literacy and responsible money management to promote long-term financial stability.\n\n- **Introduce Blockchain Technology and the Crypto Ecosystem:** We share real-world use cases of blockchain, such as DeFi, Self-sovereign digital identity, NFTs, and other applications. We also explain the fundamental concepts of blockchain, such as decentralization, transparency, and immutability, to foster a deeper understanding of the technology.\n\n- **Facilitate Hands-on Engagement with Decentralized Technologies:** Our program emphasizes experiential learning by guiding participants through the process of setting up wallets, joining decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), minting NFTs, and using other Web3 applications. This practical approach enables attendees to gain first-hand experience with these emerging technologies and develop the necessary skills to participate in the decentralized ecosystem.\n\n#aPRENDOcripto is just the start of a journey. A journey that conitinous with \"The Way of the Graduate\", a program that provides continued support for our graduates.\n\n# The Way of the Graduate\n\n\"The Way of the Graduate\" is a continuation plan for the graduates of #aPRENDOcripto. It is designed to support their personal and professional development, and create a community of #aPRENDOcripto graduates who are connected and engaged with the broader crypto community in Argentina and the region. \n\nThe program is managed by a team of coordinators and mentors, and includes three main areas of focus:\n\n### Community\n\n- Building a strong community of #aPRENDOcripto graduates through networking events and collaborative learning opportunities.\n- Creating opportunities for graduates to participate in Proof of Integrity's operations and develop skills as mentors or teachers.\n- Scheduling regular and predictable events to encourage ongoing engagement and establish a routine.\n\n### Professional Development\n\n- Offering complementary courses, videos and technical training to supplement the topics covered in the #aPRENDOcripto program, and sharing relevant news and updates from the crypto ecosystem.\n- Providing mentorship and support in developing essential soft skills, such as resume writing and interview preparation, to enhance employability in the crypto industry.\n- Offering scholarships for technology-related courses and language training (e.g. English) to increase graduates' competitiveness in the job market.\n\n### Career Placement\n\n- Building partnerships with crypto companies and projects to promote job opportunities for #aPRENDOcripto graduates.\n- Sharing curated job listings from the crypto industry that are applicable to the graduates' profiles, and providing mentorship to candidates as needed.\n- Hosting talks and discussions featuring individuals who have successfully entered the crypto job market to share their experiences and advice.\n- Facilitating internships within technology companies, whether paid or unpaid, to provide graduates with valuable on-the-job training.\n\nWe are excited about the potential for \"The Way of the Graduate\" to provide ongoing support and create new opportunities for our program graduates. \n\n# Our future plans\n\nOur future plans include **expanding the reach** of our #aPRENDOcripto program and empowering even more underprivileged communities. In 2023, we plan to conduct **26 editions** of the program, reaching more participants across Argentina and beyond. We also aim to expand the program to other regions of **Argentina**, as well as to neighboring countries such as **Uruguay** and **Chile**. We intend to start our expansion into the rest of Latin America beginning with **Honduras**. Our goal is to make blockchain education and financial literacy accessible to a wider audience. Ultimately, we envision #aPRENDOcripto becoming available throughout all of **Latin America**.\n\nOur goal is to have **400 graduates** successfully complete the program in 2023, equipping them with the skills and knowledge to participate in the decentralized ecosystem and achieve financial stability and independence.\n\n# Join Our Mission\n\nAt Proof of Integrity, we believe that blockchain and personal finance education can empower individuals and communities to achieve financial stability and independence. We invite you to support our mission and help us bring the benefits of blockchain technology to underprivileged communities.\n",

These problems are primarily due to:\n\n1. **Limited Access to Financial Education:** Many individuals in these communities lack the knowledge and tools to effectively manage their personal finances. This lack of financial literacy hinders their ability to budget, save, and manage debt, which are crucial for long-term financial stability.\n2. **Lack of Understanding of Emerging Technologies:** The rapid evolution of the digital economy, especially the advent of blockchain technology and decentralized finance, has left these communities behind. They often lack the awareness and understanding of these technologies that could otherwise provide them with financial opportunities and independence.\n3. **Barriers to Entry in the Blockchain Ecosystem:** The complexities of the blockchain and crypto ecosystems can be intimidating to newcomers, especially those from underprivileged backgrounds who may not have easy access to educational resources. This results in a lack of participation in these potentially empowering ecosystems.\n\nAt Proof of Integrity, we're dedicated to addressing these issues through our #aPRENDOcripto program.\n",

This includes operational costs like travels, materials, and facilitator fees.\n\n2. **Development of \"The Way of the Graduate\" Program:** We plan to enhance our post-graduation support by providing additional resources, mentorship, and opportunities for graduates to further their knowledge and skills in the blockchain and crypto ecosystems. This includes organizing networking events, creating educational content, and facilitating engagement with the broader crypto community.\n\n3. **Administrative and Operational Expenses:** A portion of the funding will be used for essential administrative costs to keep our organization running efficiently. \n\nEverything we receive will bring us one step closer to our goal of empowering underprivileged communities through financial literacy and blockchain education.",

Our experience will just be *reality* for all intents and purposes. We cannot let the extractive incentives and monopolies of Web 2.0 dominate the promise of this era.\n\nThe Geo Web uses [partial common ownership (aka Harberger taxes)](https://docs.geoweb.network/concepts/partial-common-ownership) to administer open consensus for geospatial publishing rights around the world. The land registry is a DNS-like pubic good for coordinating shared spatial browsing experiences. Its market structure incentivizes productive usage of land (i.e. punishes squatters+advantages those with legitimate uses)... and funds public goods.\n\n100% of the land market revenue will be allocated to public goods through quadratic funding and other participatory/free market mechanisms. This is the wei for open and permissionless to outcompete closed and extractive. \n\nThe core Geo Web team has solely been funded by grants and public goods contributions to date.

Productive, open consensus for shared geospatial AR\n2. Sustainable public goods network effects\n3. Neutralizing technical/platform lock-in\n\nOur solutions to each challenge are intertwined and supportive of each other.\n\n1. [Partial Common Ownership](https://docs.geoweb.network/concepts/partial-common-ownership) - This market structure creates incentives for landholders to actively produce value. Promoting network utility instead of a ghost town of squatters starts the virtuous cycle of [legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) and consensus for a deterministic spatial browsing experience. The alternative to this coordination is a Faustian \"free\" solution offered through an attention algorithm.\n2. [Public Goods Funding Mechanisms](https://docs.geoweb.network/community-and-governance/network-funds-allocation) - 100% of the PCO market funds are allocated to public goods and permissionless incentives to grow the network and open-source ecosystems. The Geo Web community will embrace and innovate upon allocation mechanisms like (streaming) quadratic funding, RetroPGF, and more.\n3. Non-excludable tools & applications - For the foreseeable future, AR will be delivered on hardware that attempts to privatize value into closed ecosystems. We’re working toward [frameworks that abstract away this lock-in](https://www.geoweb.network/post/augmented-worlds). But more broadly, public goods investment into creators, builders, and applications will compound open-source value and complete the virtuous cycle to Geo Web land value & consensus.",

Using our [Augmented Worlds](https://www.geoweb.network/post/augmented-worlds) framework, we're developing AR publishing capabilities that leverage image targets, geo-anchors, and 3D mesh. \n\nWe'll also soon be running our first community QF round (using Clr.fund or the Allo Protocol) and plan to further develop public goods funding mechanisms like a streaming implementation of QF.",

In this way we increased the data availability with the Autonomous Worlds model which enable decentralized, fast and reliable data access and interactions for any user. \n\nThe implamentation of the MUD framework also reduces friction on user onboarding by enabling a burner wallet generator that simplify the address management.

Onboarding n00bs through the MushyDAO collaboration:\nIt is critical for us to create a welcoming environment for technical and non-technical talent coming into web3. We have a partnership with the MushyDAO and would like to develop onboarding learning journeys that cater to MushyDAO unique experiences like ENS and claiming a POAP styled cryptoasset as a certificate of completion of in-person wellness retreat.\n\n2. Create dev onboarding Blockathon program for important projects that need support. e.g. Cryptosat random beacon that was used in the EIP4844 KZG ceremony could be relevant for many developers that don't know about it.\n3. Dedicate some resources to tidy up our website and community channels (discord)\n\n",

        "description": "Stereum is a toolkit to simplify the process of setting up and maintaining an Ethereum/Gnosis Node. It provides an intuitive GUI to ease the installation process down to a few clicks, lessening the technical entry barrier to a minimum. By reducing complexity, Stereum will therefore attract more individual stakers to the network, promoting Ethererum’s principle of decentralization.\n\nTo use Stereum, you download the launcher and connect remotely to your fresh Ubuntu server.\n\nIn only three clicks Stereum will configure all necessary prerequisites your server has to meet, install and run Ethereum client software, and will ensure that your node is properly connected and synced with the network.\n\nBy setting up your own node with Stereum, you are able to participate in Solo Staking in your prefered network and validate transactions and blocks. Your node also serves as your gateway to the network for data science, dApp usage and development.\n\nAs Stereum aims to be the most flexible way to leverage your node for ETH staking, you also have the opportunity to run different node related protocols (like SSV, OBOL, etc.) and profit of their unique architecture.",
        "category": "Tooling",
        "problemSpace": "Setting up an Ethereum Node is technically demanding and needs a lot of research & preparation to do. Being confronted with this challenge, a lot of people therefore choose to use a staking service. A understandable choice: if they are in the position of owning 32 ETH, they do not want to risk their funds. But, in turn, this slowly centralizes the network.",
        "plans": "Your contribution is greatly appreciated by the team and will be used in various ways - from development to testing, as well as language bounties or other community initiatives. Running the necessary testnet servers are our main costs and we spend the income generated through grants and donations mainly on this. Funds will therefore benefit the progress & security of the project and enable broader decentralization of Ethereum / Gnosis as well as other protocols on it (like SSV, OBOL, etc.).",
        "teamName": "RockLogic GmbH",
        "teamDescription": "The RockLogic GmbH was founded in 2012 in Austria & has experience in various industries. The Stereum project came into being as a hobby project of our managing director Stefan Kobrc with the genesis of the testnet of the beaconchain and over the course of Ethereum`s development roadmap went through multiple iterations. The development for the 2.0.0 version started in 2022. Stereum is completely Open Source, freely available to use & is currently close to being launched as full release this summer.",

After signing in, transactions being made from the wallet do not require any additional signature prompts. We've proven the tech and concept with a working app, and now we want to build an open source SDK for other builders to benefit from this.\n\n\n# Signless\nnever sign a transaction again\n\n\n## Objectives\nThis aims to improve the web3 user experience to make it more accessible for the general public who is not used to signing transactions when they navigate the interwebs, and is especially useful (but not exclusively) for web3 social dapps and games.\n\nWe’ve proven the concept with a forked Safe and [Lens Clubs](https://app.lensclubs.xyz/clubs/0x5a20b9b2606d0343fd102e4d0d8930fa7844a857/settings), and now we want to build an SDK to make it easier for other devs to also integrate signless into their dapps.\n\n\n## Demo\n\nCheck out our video demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZOrwSY4cVM)\n\nThen try it yourself on a Safe fork [here](https://safe.signless.xyz/welcome) !\n\nA demonstration of Signless is implemented as a Gnosis Safe module in [this repository](https://github.com/signless-ux/signless-safe). To enable Signless for a Safe:\n\n1. First, the user must use the [Signless Safe](https://safe.signless.xyz/) forked webapp.  GitHub: [gnosis-safe-web-core](https://github.com/kevincharm/gnosis-safe-web-core)\n\n2. A user enables the Signless module for their Safe in the Settings/Signless tab.\n\n3. The user then creates an ephemeral private key that lives in their browser's local storage.\n\n4. This ephemeral key is registered as a delegate on the Signless module for this particular Safe.\n\nAfter the above steps have been executed, the user will be able to browse Safe Apps without ever having to sign a transaction again (at least, until the ephemeral key expires). This is possible as the Signless Safe webapp intercepts any incoming transaction signing request, signs it with the stored ephemeral key, then submits it to the Gelato Relay network. Gas fees are paid using native tokens in the Safe.",

These challenges create the need for regenerative tourism in Tulum.\n[![wasteplasticbeach.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/nrZWm52b/wasteplasticbeach.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/Pp3KsS02)\n\n## Environmental Degradation\n- Strain on the fragile ecosystem\n- Damage to coral reefs, deforestation, pollution of cenotes, and depletion of water resources\n- Increased demand for housing from expats and construction activities\n\n## Lack of Infrastructure and Services\n- Inadequate waste management systems\n- Insufficient transportation options\n- Lack of public facilities\n- Lack of education about waste management or new technology solutions that help us address the problem\n\n## Influence of Hype and Media\n- Culture of overtourism and unsustainable practices\n- Focus on short-term experiences, neglecting long-term well-being\n- Party and influencer culture that uses Tulum for image but leaves during low season without any care for Tulum's well being.\n\nTo address these challenges, regenerative tourism is needed in Tulum. Regenerative tourism goes beyond sustainability by actively restoring the environment, preserving cultural heritage, and supporting local communities.\n\nBy embracing regenerative tourism, Tulum can:\n- Restore the ecosystem\n- Preserve cultural identity\n- Ensure well-being of residents and visitors\n\nRegenerative tourism offers an opportunity to shift the paradigm from exploitation to regeneration, allowing Tulum to thrive sustainably for generations to come.\n",

Unitap is here to help. We are building a platform for learning the basics by doing, and distributing project, DAO and gas tokens to onboard the world to web3.\n\nIf you have a friend and you want them to learn crypto, send them to https://unitap.app.\n\nBenefits:\n\nReduced costs: Unitap allows users to claim gas tokens and other digital assets for free, making it affordable to get started with web3.\n\nEasy access: Our Taps provide a simple and intuitive way for users to obtain digital assets, without the need for technical expertise or specialized knowledge.\n\nSybil resistance: Most faucets are abused by bad actors, sybils and bots. We use BrightID to prevent malicious actors and bots from abusing our faucets, ensuring that each real human can claim their fair share of digital assets. As technology advances (for example, with BrightID’s new Aura verification method), Unitap will adopt the best anti-sybil solutions.\n\nHow it works:\nUnitap provides a series of Taps that remove obstacles for new web3 users in their onboarding path, including:\n\nGas Tap - live today\n\nTo start learning web3, you need a tiny amount of gas, but it’s often frustrating to get it. Gas Tap solves this.\n\nMore than 4,000 users have already claimed over 50,000 drips of gas tokens on 20 different networks.\n\nWe will soon be launching additional Taps including:\n\nLearn Tap - Learn about web3 by using it. Learn Tap guides new users to make their very first steps into web3 including wallet creation, obtaining gas, and doing their first on-chain transactions.\n\nToken Tap - Claim project and DAO tokens. Token tap allows projects and DAOs to easily democratize governance. Because Unitap claimers are limited in how many types of project or DAO tokens they can claim, they’re more likely to be interested in holding and using the tokens.\n\nPrize Tap - Enter to win raffles for larger prizes. Sometimes it’s more impactful to give more tokens to fewer recipients. We are partnering with ChainLink to provide open and auditable raffles.\n\nFor all taps, we limit claims to 5 per user (for example) out of potentially thousands of token choices. This forces claimers to pick the tokens they value most. It provides important feedback and curation–with the most valuable and useful tokens rising to the top.",

Our Telegram group has almost 300 members, and our monthly meetups (one online, one IRL) have around 20 attendees on average. Our goal for this year is to bring more developers to the community by organising a Hackathon with the objective of solving the current Bolivian banking crisis.\n\n# Ethereum Bolivia\n\n## Background\n\nBolivia is a hostile environment for a community of Ethernauts. And it is not because of the lack of oxygen due to the altitude, but because the commerce of cryptocurrency is prohibited.\n\nDespite the circumstances, the Ethereum Bolivia community has managed to organize events with more than 100 attendees. The secret: focus on development and embrace the situation as an opportunity.\n\nIn our last meeting, the community showed a lot of interest in actively participating and working groups were formed with 3 objectives in particular:\nCreate education programs IN SPANISH and support for ecosystem developers, with a focus on underserved communities\nSupport for Web3 projects that solve local problems.\nInform and educate authorities and government\n\nFirst project ideas include: creating a DAO to make validator nodes more accessible and encourage decentralization by creating \"The World's Highest Validator Node\", an information group to get government institutions to remove the cryptocurrency ban, a diploma course to learn about blockchain, etc…\n\n## What we’ve achieved\nSince July we’ve had a monthly meet-up in La Paz, and this year we started doing monthly online meet-ups as well. Our monthly meetings host between 10 and 30 people, and we started to organise some events in the second largest city as well: Santa Cruz.\n\nIn August 2022 we hosted our Ethereum Bolivia - Road to Devcon event at the Univalle university, and hosted around 150 people.\n\nTogether with ETH Kipu, we’re currently organising a Solidity development course in collaboration with some of the most important universities in each of those two cities.\n\n### Our regular activities\nMonthly in-person meet-up in the two biggest cities: La Paz & Santa Cruz\nMonthly on-line meet-up\nYearly Ethereum Bolivia event to educate the broader public + hackathon\nRegular workshops around different topics (e.g. solidity development, intro to web3, etc..)\n",

        "description": "## Summary\nWe are creating a platform for wildlife sanctuaries around the world to adopt Web3 technology to receive donations. Supporting animals through NFTs will give you access to a video game to interact with digital versions of the animals, customise their environments and visit those of your friends, as well as view cameras from inside the sanctuaries. There will be several different NFTs of each animal, made by volunteers and artists who have interacted with them IRL.\n\nVisit [wildfriends.xyz](https://wildfriends.xyz) for more information.\n\n# Wild Friends\nAdopt virtual animals and support real ones - in collaboration with [Senda Verde Bolivia](https://sendaverde.org/)\n[wildfriends.xyz](https://wildfriends.xyz/)\n\n## Intro\nA game to support wildlife sanctuaries through digital collectibles (NFTs) of the animals living in the shelter. These digital collectibles will be used to unlock different animals inside the game, you will earn daily rewards for taking care of your animals and with these rewards you will customise your animal's environment. If possible, you will get access to the cameras inside the wildlife sanctuary. The pilot for this project is [Senda Verde](https://sendaverde.org), an exotic animal shelter in Bolivia. \n\n\n## Vision\nGuided by the purpose of creating a healthier planet, our vision is a world richer in nature where wildlife thrives. We have seen a tremendous opportunity to expand the animal refuge model with web3, thanks to recent advances in regenerative finance and support for public goods.\n\nAmong the opportunities that web3 brings, we have identified 3 relevant uses for Wild Friends that can be expanded to other refuges:\n- Open source allows this model to be replicable to more animal shelters and to create a network of mutually supporting shelters\n- NFTs and SBTs (Soulbound tokens) to reward volunteers, artists and donors who support Senda Verde.\n- A video game to connect with wildlife sanctuaries without the need to physically visit them.\n\n## How it works\nVolunteers, artists and the Senda Verde team stand out for their ability to create art inspired by the experience of visiting the sanctuary and sharing with the animals, listening to their stories and transmitting them to the world.\n\nThese works of art (painting, photography, video, drawing or even music) thanks to web3 have a lot of potential to generate an income that will help to give sustainability to Senda Verde. So we will use them to create digital collectibles (in the form of NFTs) that not only generate revenue, but also social awareness, entertainment, engagement and a sense of community.\n\nWe are creating an engaging and interactive way to motivate the purchase and use of these digital collectibles. The form is a video game where collectors can interact with digital versions of the animals, collect artwork of the animals and visit those of their friends. The “book of collectibles” will function as a \"Green Passport\" to show your friends the different refuges you supported, the art of the animals and even access the cameras of the animal you are supporting.\n\n## Our MVP\nFor our MVP we developed a simple game in Unity where you can move, feed and give water to the animal. We also have a basic environment customization system. As of now we have 4 playable animals: jaguar, bear, caiman and deer. \n\nFor the Web3 implementations, we used [Bonfire](https://www.bonfire.xyz) to build our website and to token-gate the page with the game embed. [Decent](https://www.decent.xyz) was used to mint the NFTs that give you access to the different animals.\n\nAs our project gains more traction, we will develop our own systems to tackle this problems. We are currently integrating Third Web's SDK\n\n## Previous funding and future funding\nWe received a lot of support during the Devcon VI Bogota CLR QF Round, and we used those funds to develop our MVP. Now that we have a proof of concept and have received a lot of attention from big players in the ecosystem, we want to level up the game mechanics and focus those resources in hiring another game developer, while continuing with our marketing and partnership efforts. At the same time, we need to abstract away all the web3 touch points (connecting wallet, etc...), so that the user can experience the game without going through that steep learning curve.\n",

He also talks and writes in traditional media (newspapers, radio, television) and is invited to many conferences, events and organizations to talk about these technologies.\nHis personal goal is to teach people what crypto is and how it can change their lives for good. So in march 2021 he founded Defy Education: an academy to learn about Blockchain technology and DeFi and 6 months ago decided to create Defy Foundation, to make all contents open and fee.\nhttps://twitter.com/PabloSabbatella/ \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/psabbatella/\nhttps://pablosabbatella.com/ \nhttps://twitter.com/DefyEducation/ \nhttps://defyeducation.com/ \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/school/defyeducation/ \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLze6ciY1eg\nhttps://www.a24.com/economia/la-revolucion-crypto-es-inevitable-quien-es-este-ex-hacker-que-conocio-al-creador-ethereum-y-evangeliza-finanzas-descentralizadas-n989285 \nhttps://es-us.finanzas.yahoo.com/noticias/funcionan-cripto-pr%C3%A9stamos-negocio-bitcoin-213000587.html\nhttps://hipertextual.com/2022/05/argentina-criptomonedas-sistema-bancario\n\nMatias Goya: Coordinator & researcher.\nMatias is former JP Morgan, graduate in International Trade with specialization in Finance with experience in research on crypto assets and Bitcoin.\nHe used to be Crypto researcher at AMI regarding payments with FIAT and crypto:  https://americasmi.com/insights/category/cryptocurrency/ .\nHe also researches and writes about Blockchain technology, specifically about privacy and consensus mechanisms.\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/matias-goya/\n\nBruno Torossi: Content researcher.\nPublic accountant, specialized in finance with experience in capital markets and education.

She specialized in \"capital markets\" through international training, courses, and exams. She worked as an equity and fixed income trader for four years before establishing herself as an investment advisor, a profession she continues to practice to this day.\nSince 2017, she has recognized herself as a \"blockchain enthusiast\" and seizes every opportunity to learn and connect with people in that field. That is why, in 2020, she and her partner founded Proyecto Kuhn. Together, they aim to bring blockchain closer to sectors of society that are still unfamiliar with the topic and contribute to reflection and debate. The spirit of blockchain is that a person with some programming knowledge can enter the field and contribute better developments than those of their creators. At Proyecto Kuhn, they believe that this can be replicated at all levels and that anyone can be a leader in creating this new paradigm. She likes researching Public goods and the way blockchain can change finances. One of her personal missions is to convey the idea that blockchain is a technology capable of changing the world.\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/albana-rodriguez-capurro-38a37a12/ \nhttps://twitter.com/albinmrc\nhttps://twitter.com/EthereumUruguay \nhttps://proyectokuhn.com/ \n\nCristobal Garcia: Content researcher\n(tobal.eth) Content Lead & DAO Contributor.\nCristóbal has been contributing to the web3 and crypto ecosystem since 2018 in various marketing roles.

        "description": "PREPchain *reverses* the large-scale climate impacts of blockchain technology, while making blockchain more secure & decentralized!  In this network, block sealing capacity is proportional not to energy burned or economic resources posted, but electricity produced from renewable sources.\n\nIn a blockchain network using Proof of Work (PoW) like Bitcoin, one’s ability to participate in securing the network is proportional to the amount of energy they burn. Someone trying to break the immutability/security guarantees would have to burn more energy than the rest of the network combined, which would be costly & noticeable. This makes for great security but major negative planetary impacts, with Bitcoin using more electricity than several midsize developed countries, and almost getting blockchain technology banned in some jurisdictions.  Even where Bitcoin is mined using a renewable energy source, that is generally renewable electricity not being used for some other purpose for which dirtier energy sources are being used instead.\n\nIn Proof of Stake (PoS), each participant’s ability to participate in securing the network is proportional to their committed economic resources. This is close to neutral in terms of impact on planetary sustainability, but presents some additional security vulnerabilities especially to very well-resourced actors.  \n\nProof of Renewable Electricity Production (PREP) takes another step at least as large in the same sustainability direction, setting participants’ abilities to participate in securing the network proportional to the amount of electricity each one **produces** from renewable sources like wind and solar, which can then be used for any purpose.  \n\nHistorically, there was a lot of resistance to using blockchain-based decentralized applications that could add a lot of value to sustainability objectives (e.g. sustainable supply chain track and trace, carbon credit trading) because of the climate impact of Proof of Work. The Merge got rid of most of those objections, but a chain going a big step further will actively draw in sustainability-oriented DApps, followed by those which are formally neutral with respect to climate impacts but would like to be on a more sustainability-enhancing chain.  With this project, we could take the huge amount of economic power which will soon be pouring into blockchain technology because of the real value it offers, and use that economic power to incentivize production of energy from renewable sources, on top of all the other incentives for doing that.  \n\nThis project could also enhance the security and decentralization of blockchain technology, because ownership of renewable electricity production assets is more decentralized than e.g. ownership of money or Bitcoin mines, and building renewable electricity production facilities that could overwhelm the rest of the world would be more costly, noticeable, and slow than trying to do something similar in a Proof of Stake system.  If Proof of Stake’s vulnerabilities to well-resourced actors suddenly become a salient issue for many ecosystem stakeholders, planetary sustainability requires that we have ready a better system to turn to than a return to Proof of Work.  Ideally, we’d be able to make an orderly transition to this new system before any such panic arises.\n\nThere are several ways in which production quantification numbers could be secured, as improvements over the existing strategies for controlling large financial flows already based on production quantification numbers (e.g. renewable energy credits, carbon offsets, and production tax incentives).  Ideally, long-term, a governing consortia/DAO would include representatives of inverter manufacturers who would include hardware sufficient to store a unique key that can cryptographically sign generation reports, assign them to the owner’s account or designee, and support the cancelable delayed redirection of credits when the ownership of the generation facility changes hands without digital assets following.  A sufficient subset of sealers who already have stake in the network could also be required to physically inspect any new facility and vouch for it, along with a fraud-challenge mechanism which could be supported by publication of generation-asset coordinate data that bounty hunters could model against e.g. weather and sometimes satellite-image data.  Generation credits could be capped according to the design of an installation and existing verification & validation systems already in use for Renewable Energy Credit generation could be tapped into to help with verification steps.  \n\nThe technical and consortium-building work appears nontrivial but feasible.  \n\nPREP can give us a better planet AND better blockchain technology. This project helps address the climate crisis on a national-equivalent scale, while also making a blockchain that can be more decentralized and resistant to takeover than the most widely used status quo chains. Let's make it happen!\n",

In PREP, it is only the *production* of energy from a renewable source that counts, and the energy can then be used for any purpose at all.  \n\nThis project helps address the climate crisis on a national-equivalent scale, while also making a blockchain that can be more decentralized and resistant to takeover than the most widely used status quo chains. \n\nIt is categorized as “research” because support for the project at this early stage would help support the research needed to make this concept a reality.\n",

This will produce a whitepaper which is more well-researched and rigorous than many others out there. This type of expenditure historically has an excellent return in the form of focusing future efforts and better supporting leverage of existing work that already exists, instead of slower and more costly efforts spent reinventing wheels.  \n\nYour support now could also be an excellent investment that helps the project grow by many times the amount of your donation beyond even the matching pool, if this research helps the project secure a larger grant, for example from the USD $94B global fund intended to support demonstrations of technology that can accelerate clean energy transitions, which was [announced](https://www.energy.gov/articles/united-states-announces-94-billion-global-public-funding-accelerate-clean-energy-worldwide) at the Clean Energy Ministerials in September 2022.  There are a lot of grantmaking organizations whose missions are aligned with this project, but even just reading through all the details of the various opportunities and preparing an application is a serious effort, competing for the time of skilled professionals with other funded projects.  Your donations now could help support the project in a way that makes that much more likely to be successful!\n",

Offering the necessary tools so that Web3 and Ethereum have a real utility and are adapted to their daily lives.\n\nOn the other hand, we want to grow the number of builders and developers in the country, with activities such as courses, hackathons or bootcamps, dozens of participants will learn from the basics to specialized topics such as Solidity. \n\nWe want to aim to have a community of around 3000 active people in all our networks and 500 direct beneficiaries. \n\nThis community project aims to have a duration of one year, in which we will be working on specialized initiatives for a duration of three months each, in conjunction with the organization of meetups and online and face-to-face learning sessions across the country throughout the year. \n\nOur main goal is to visit all the states of the country, but although Venezuela is not a very big country, it can be a somewhat complicated task. For now, our main objectives are: Carabobo, Miranda, Aragua, Vargas, Anzoátegui, Mérida, Táchira, Bolivar.\n\nWe have defined 3 areas of action: \n- Online community building and creation of educational materials. \n- Face-to-face learning sessions and web3 onboarding to vulnerable communities. \n- Promotion and education around the Ethereum ecosystem for technical profiles (developers and related). \n\nWe will track all of our in-person events online, by live streaming as many as possible. We will also organize online events around different general topics of the crypto ecosystem, as well as some more specialized sessions: women in crypto, Venezuelans in technology, and community impact projects in the region. \n\nEach activity will have a POAP that will be minted by all attendees.

        "problemSpace": "The problem statement addressed by Atlantis revolves around the challenges faced by builders, entrepreneurs, and creators in the climate and social impact sector. \n\nThese individuals and organizations often encounter various obstacles in setting up, measuring, and verifying the impact of their projects. Some of the key problems include:\n\n1. Lack of efficient tools: \nMany existing tools and platforms for impact measurement are complex, expensive, or not tailored specifically to the needs of the impact sector. This makes it difficult for builders and entrepreneurs to track and quantify the social and environmental impact of their initiatives accurately.\n\n2. Fragmented impact measurement: \nImpact projects often involve multiple stakeholders, diverse activities, and complex outcomes. Coordinating and consolidating impact data from different sources becomes a challenging task. There is a need for a streamlined and standardized approach to impact measurement that allows for easy aggregation and analysis.\n\n3. Limited transparency and verification: \nThe credibility and transparency of impact work are essential for attracting funding, engaging stakeholders, and building trust. However, existing systems may lack reliable methods for verifying the impact claims made by organizations, leading to skepticism and difficulty in securing support.\n\n4. Lack of collaboration and decentralized solutions: \nBuilding effective solutions to address climate and social challenges requires collaboration among different organizations, researchers, and communities. However, the current landscape often lacks decentralized platforms that facilitate collaboration, information sharing, and resource pooling.\n\n5. Inadequate access to funding and resources: \nMany impact projects struggle to secure the necessary financial resources and expertise to implement their initiatives effectively. This hampers the scalability and long-term sustainability of these projects, limiting their overall impact.\n",

Rebuilding Turkey - Working with EarthistDAO and Anka Fund in Turkey - helping onground orgs NGOS to deploy and implement funds in a transparent manner across multiple rehabilitation and restoration projects. The partnership will involve using the Atlantis Citizen App to distribute the raised fund ($300,000) to numerous local organisations and carry out their impact work.\n\n2. Public Goods Service - With Solarpunk Nomads\nUsing an electric vehicle bought with Gitcoin funds we will conduct climate awareness drives across Bangalore colleges, educating students on opportunities and green jobs around #ReFi and #Web3. We also plan to conduct clean up drives across Atlantis Pilot locations in Gokarna and Chikmagalur.\n\n3. Tree Planting - in collaboration with Treegens - mangrove planting along the coastlines of Western Ghats. We are currently working out permits that will allow the Treegen team to plant the trees. The entire operation will be captured on Atlantis Citizen App recording all the verifiable data points that will validate the onground efforts.\n\n4. Provide subsidized water filters to 3000 people in Chikkamagaluru, helping secure clean drinking water. We are looking to raise $3000 to complete this project. The water filters will be distributed among underserved communities in Chikmagalur with complete traceability.\n\nFocus on technology (Bringing additional features to the Atlantis Citizen App):\n1. Develop Atlantis Impact Certificates - The Impact Certs provide real-time and high context certificates to the investors and project developers for the impact work they do. The impact certificates will be critical to incentivize and create value for a wide range of social and climate-positive actions.\n\n2. Develop Atlantis Oracle in partnership with Lunarpunk Labs.

Also, we plan to retribute to the mentors for their time.\nWorkshops: We plan to give online and offline workshops about Web3 in Argentina and Spain for now.

Voltaire is designed to operate within the peer-to-peer mempool of UserOperations, facilitating the inclusion of transactions on-chain more quickly and efficiently.\n\nVoltaire presently has complete coverage of the compatibility test suites written by ERC-4337 team. These test suites ensure that different bundlers can communicate effectively and defend against DDoS attack vectors. \n\nVoltaire is open-source, meaning that anyone can launch Voltaire and start bundling user operations for a service fee. By enabling anyone to participate in the network, the mempool becomes more robust when facing censorship attacks.\n\nA big of part of our inspiration for Voltaire is Trinity, a previous open-source Ethereum client implementation written in Python. We would like to thank the Trinity team, as well as all Python community members for their open-source contributors.\n\n# Candide Wallet\n\nOpen source smart contract mobile wallet - Available on both IOS and Android. Featuring:\n- On-Chain Recovery - Forget Seedphrases. Recovering a wallet though designated Recovery Contacts\n\n- Decentralized Focused - Designed to be censorship resistant and free from third party control with ERC-4337\n\n- Dapp with a Single Tap - Leveraging the power of Account Abstraction, bringing bundled calls in standardized way\n\n- Pay Network Fees with Stablecoins - Pay gas fees with supported ERC-20s\n\nFor a bit of background, EIP 4337 is the account abstraction standard for Ethereum & EVM equivalent chains that doesn't compromise on decentralisation and censorship resistance. In practical terms, this means smart contract wallets that don't depend on centralised relayers controlled by a single entity. The role of centralised relayers is replaced with a p2p network of new entities called Bundlers. As the p2p network is still in development, bundlers currently operate as standalone endpoints until they are able to participate in the unified mempool.\n  ",

        "problemSpace": "According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in Latin America the percentage of women in the technology sector is around 25%, lower than the world average of 30%. In terms of web 3 technologies, blockchain and decentralized networks, the participation of women is even lower, with estimates ranging from 5-10%.\nThere are several factors that contribute to the low participation of women in the technology sector in Latin America. These include the lack of networking spaces to meet people from the technological field, another reason is gender stereotypes and biases, and finally mentioning the lack of access to education and training opportunities.\nFor this reason, at Women Biz our mission is to connect more women to the technological ecosystem of the web3 by holding events to inspire, educate and encourage networking among women. We also connect them with more women by generating networking networks and looking for growth opportunities.\n",
        "plans": "We want to support more women bringing them opportunities to travel abroud and knowing more about web3 ecosystem. \n\nWe want our girls to be able to experience new adventures by traveling abroad and without spending a lot, so we want them to receive scholarships to attend these web3 events in North America, Europe, Asia, or South America.\nWe have a lot of potential to exploit and that is beneficial for the girls. Many of them have not left the country and even live in very remote areas of Peru, therefore we want to offer them opportunities that have a great impact and are very beneficial for them.\nWe are more than 700 women and we will count on your support to continue growing.\n\nEach coin adds up.",
