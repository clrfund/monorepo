The value created by TREE will is allocated to several pools, one being a Charity Pool. TREE also serves as the Governance Token of the TREE Charity Pool, meaning TREE holders receive a vote in how the Charity Fund is allocated to each Charity.\n\n**Resource on TREE:**\n\n-   Intro Blog Post\n-   Smart Contracts\n\nGoals of our Grant\n------------------\n\nSo far we are completely self funding. We have launched a DAO on IDChain and have built the Smart Contracts for TREE. WhalerDAO plans for utilizing funding: Our plan is to use the donations to help pay for a security audit of the smart contracts used in our first project TREE, an elastic supply token that generates funding for charities. The donations we receive in excess will directly fund the charity treasury used by TREE, and will eventually be paid out to charities as decided by TREE holders using Conviction Voting. If you also believe that we should be working towards how to use DeFi for good, help the ecosystem and fund our grant. This is a community driven project, so we're reaching out to you the community for help.",

BUT...that is no longer the case.\n\n\nBlockchain can provide us with a better alternative to direct society at large.\n\n\nYou can read more here:\n\n\nhttps://planetarycouncil.org/\n\n\nhttps://planetarycouncil.org/COP26-key-policies_2021-10-26.pdf\n\n\n\nGlobal Government - Digital Economy - New Social Contract - New World Order showcase\n\n\nEVERYTHING IS OPEN SOURCE\n\n﻿EVERYTHING IS PUBLIC HERE\n\n\nBlockchain systems are open source. Meaning that anyone can read the code & see the rules for themselves. This means NONE can game the system, discriminate against minorities, or cheat, or evade paying taxes.\n\n\nThe whole point is we use it because we want to, not because the government demand us to.\n\n\nOPEN SOURCE ALLOW EVERYONE TO BECOME LAW-MAKER\n\nSO,\n\nWE CAN WRITE THE NEW SOCIAL CONTRACT TOGETHER.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix:\n\nPeople are asking: Why do I have to vote if everything's the same? They don't believe in real change.\n\nFor instance: I am an entrepreneur, I have to incorporate my company, I have my company incorporated in the UK, now I am in SF, to receive funds from investors here I have to incorporate my company in the US. I am from Argentina, I also pay my taxes there. So, where do I have to pay taxes? In the UK, In the US, In Argentina. I also have my E-residence in Estonia, I have my NGO there. Does NGO have to pay taxes?\n\n\nEntrepreneurs in the US are asking: How can I receive investment from CHINA, RUSIA, BOLIVIA? Not allowed in the US.\n\n\nOther Ask: How can we receive support from governments? When I am talking about changing the world together, Govs & Companies, everyone say to me, \"forget it. Its bureaucracy, everything is arranged in advance, you can not do anything with them.\"\n\n\nAnother example: I was opening my FTX account: I was in US jurisdiction. My chip of my cellphone is from Argentina. I also have another chip from the UK, because my company is there and I was living there. I also have another chip in the US because I am living here now. I was trying to open my account from the US. The US is not allowed to open FTX here, so I downloaded VPN. To change the jurisdiction, I have to change the chip in my cellphone to get the SMS double-check corresponding with the jurisdiction I was opening the account.\n\n\nChanging 3 chips in my cellphone, changing 3 jurisdictions to open the account, one country, another country, one phone, another phone. So. I realized we need a Global Digital Jurisdiction. Global citizens, Global Services, 5G. Starlink.\n\n\nOther day: One friend asked me, I love your project about taxation, but how are you thinking to avoid double taxation?\n\n\n\nAnswer: GLOBAL GOVERNMENT - GLOBAL DIGITAL JURISDICTION - GLOBAL TAX\n\n",
