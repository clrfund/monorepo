# How to tally votes

Only a funding round coordinator can tally votes.


### Tally votes

Install MACI dependencies (see the github action, `.github/workflows/test-scripts.yml` for all the dependencies to install)

Run the script monorepo/.github/scripts/download-6-8-2-3.sh to download the parameter files.

Set the following env vars in `.env`:

```
# private key for decrypting messages
COORDINATOR_MACISK=<coordinator-private-key>

# private key for interacting with contracts
WALLET_MNEMONIC=
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Decrypt messages and tally the votes:

```
HARDHAT_NETWORK=<network> yarn ts-node cli/tally.ts --clrfund <clrfund-address> --start-block <maci-start-block>
```

If there's error and the tally task was stopped prematurely, it can be resumed by passing 2 additional parameters, '--maci-logs' and/or '--maci-state-file', if the files were generated.

Result will be saved to `tally.json` file, which must then be published via IPFS.

**Using [command line](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/kubo/cli/#ipfs)**

```
# start ipfs daemon in one terminal
ipfs daemon

# in a diff terminal, go to `/contracts` (or where you have the file) and publish the file
ipfs add tally.json
```

### Finalize round

Make sure you have the following env vars in `.env`. Ignore this if you are running a local test round in `localhost`, the script will know these values itself.

```
# private key of the owner of the clrfund contract for interacting with the contract
WALLET_MNEMONIC=
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=
```

Once you have the `tally.json` from the tally script, run:

```
yarn hardhat clr-finalize --clrfund <clrfund address> --tally-file <tally file> --network <network>
```

# How to verify the tally results

Anyone can verify the tally results in the tally.json.

From the clrfund contracts folder, run the following command to verify the result:

```
yarn hardhat verify-tally-file --tally-file <tally file> --tally-address <tally contract address> --network <network>
```

# How to enable the leaderboard view

After finalizing the round, enable the leaderboard view in the vue-app by exporting the round information as follow:

1) Set the etherscan API key in the hardhat.config.ts file in the contracts folder
2) Export the round and tally result

```sh
cd contracts

yarn hardhat clr-export-round --output-dir ../vue-app/src/rounds --network <network> --round-address <round address> --operator <operator> --start-block <recipient-registry-start-block> --ipfs <ipfs-gateway-url>

```
3) Build and deploy the app



## Troubleshooting
If you encountered `core dumped` while running the genProofs script as seen in this [issue](https://github.com/clrfund/monorepo/issues/383), make sure the files are not corrupted due to disk space issue, e.g. check file sizes, checksum, and missing files.

Also, lack of memory can also cause `core dump`, try to work around it by setting `max-old-space-size` before rrunning the tally script.
```
export NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096
```
